# CI/CD Pipeline and Kubernetes Deployment – DevOps Engineering Project

This repository contains a presentation that outlines the CI/CD, containerization, and Kubernetes deployment project I led as a DevOps Engineer at Gyzertech.

##  Project Overview

I was responsible for implementing end-to-end DevOps workflows for two containerized applications across development and staging environments. The project focused on automation, scalability, and observability using modern DevOps tools and cloud infrastructure.

##  Key Deliverables

- Implemented CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions**
- Containerized applications with **Docker**
- Deployed services to **Azure Virtual Machines** and **Kubernetes (AKS) clusters**
- Provisioned AKS infrastructure using **Terraform**
- Managed and monitored applications using **New Relic**
- Integrated **database migrations** into the pipeline using tools like DBeaver

## Tech Stack
